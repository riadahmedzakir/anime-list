            "On the first day of his residency at the hospital, the first step to fulfilling his dream of becoming a doctor, Takuya met his childhood friend Mio for the first time in many years. She was now a nurse and showed him around during his busy training days.",
            "One day, he fell down the stairs while protecting her and broke his right arm and left leg. As a result, his residency was put on hold while he was hospitalized. He was placed in Mio’s ward and she felt responsible for the accident. To cheer her up, he suggested that she could take care of him whenever she has free time, to which she readily agreed. It is the beginning of a hospital love story between a medical intern and a nurse who would go above her duties to take care of him.",

            "In the late 21st century, humankind came under a fierce attack from aliens who suddenly appeared via wormholes. They were helpless to fight against them and resigned themselves to imminent death. At that time, an ultimate weapon which could create items out of imagination was discovered in a expansive cave under Japan, along with its young master Ryuusei who was in cryostasis. The indiscriminate alien attacks awoke him and he led the humans to a decisive victory.",
            "One year later, while the areas which had been destroyed by the aliens were still being rebuilt, Ryuusei was appointed as the commander of the newly-formed Defence Force of Earth, which was created to fight against space invaders. However, he was the only person who could use the ‘imagination embodiment device’. If something was to happen to him, then calamity would befall the world. So the Defence Force of Earth decided to recruit girls with potential to fight alongside him. Even though they hesitated at first, they each had their own reasons to join Ryuusei. Thus, the special force ‘Blade Briders’ was formed, to protect the Earth against the aliens who have returned.",
